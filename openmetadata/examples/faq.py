"""
Q: Why associate metadata with content?

A: To support the notion of programmable content. Like with documentation
    and the code it documents, metadata changes often and storing it
    separately from where it is consumed often leads to out-of-date
    information. Open Metadata allows for an "eat your own dog-food"-
    methodology in that metadata is not only stored but used as well.

Q: How do I store my lists and dicts (i.e. collection data-types)?

A: There are exactly two methods of storing any data:
    1. Blobs
    2. Open Metadata-types

    Open Metadata can store any arbitrary data as blobs. Blobs are stored
    together with its parent; i.e. in the simples of situation, blobs are
    copied from their source into the Open Metadata hierarchy.

    While blobs facilitate storage of any arbitrary data, Open Metadata also
    has the notion of Open Metadata-types.

    Open Metadata-types offer extended features for plain-data, such as text,
    numbers, dates and matrices in that they may be added, subtracted, version-
    controlled and eventually end up in user interfaces as views and editors
    relevant to their specific type.

    The advantage of each ultimately depends on your use-case, but in short:

    - If control > performance, use Open Metadata-types
    - If control < performance, use Blobs
