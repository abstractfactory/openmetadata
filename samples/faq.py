Q: Why store data in relation to content?

A: To support the notion of programmable content. Like with documentation
    and the code it documents, metadata changes often and storing it
    separately from where it is consumed often leads to out-of-date
    information. Open Metadata allows for an "eat your own dog-food"-
    methodology in that metadata is not only stored but used as well.

"""
Q: How do I concatenate paths?

A: With Open Metadata nodes, there should be very little reason to have
    to manually concatenate paths. The reason this is is because Open
    Metadata could run on any platform, and won't necessarily be dealing
    with paths on a file-system; e.g. they might be paths in a database or
    any arbitrary storage-model.

Q: How do I store my lists and dicts (i.e. collection data-types)?

A: There are exactly two methods of storing any data:
    1. Blobs

    Open Metadata can store any arbitrary data as blobs. Blobs are stored

    While blobs facilitate storage of any arbitrary data, Open Metadata also
    has the notion of Open Metadata-types.

    Open Metadata-types offer extended features for plain-data, such as text,
    numbers, dates and matrices in that they may be added, subtracted, version-
    controlled and eventually end up in user interfaces as views and editors
    relevant to their specific type.
