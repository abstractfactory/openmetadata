Open Metadata
=============

![](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/av2x8gel580ow48/om2_hierarchy.png)

Open Metadata is designed for programmers and scripters for use in data-oriented software architectures to facilitate the idea of programmable content.

```python
# Simplest use-case
>>> import openmetadata as om
>>> om.write('/home/marcus', 27, 'age')
>>> om.read('/home/marcus', 'age')
27

# More in /samples

```

Open Metadata is GPLv3 licensed software built upon the following open-source specifications. (Some not available at this moment, apologies for this)

# What is programmable content?

In a data-oriented architecture, data controls the flow of information, not your software. Your software is designed to take instructions from data external to itself as a way to de-couple programmers from implementers.

This way, implementers can design their software by means of placing content, in a hierarchy for instance, that governs what actions the software may take in which order.

Open Metadata was designed to facilitate metadata in content management. With metadata in content, it is possible to treat each file or folder as an stateful, intelligent unit capable of making desicions; this is what I call programmable content.
